# Data Encoding

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green)](LICENSE)

PHP complete implementation of [RFC 4648](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4648). Provides methods for data encoding and decoding in multiple bases - including custom encoding.

Uses bitwise operations to provide faster processing than string functions would do.

Note that both base16 and base64 encoding styles are already natively supported by PHP through `base64_encode`/`base64_decode` and `bin2hex`/`hex2bin` functions.

## 1 Installation

```sh
composer require covaleski/data-encoding
```

## 2 Usage

The following encoding styles - defined in RFC 4648 - are natively provided by this library:

- base16:
  - Encoding with case-insensitive 16 character alphabet;
  - Available through `Base16` class;
- base32:
  - Encoding with case-insensitive 32 character alphabet;
  - Available through `Base32` class;
- base32hex:
  - Base32 with base16 extended alphabet;
  - Available through `Base32Hex` class;
- base64:
  - Encoding with case-sensitive 64 character alphabet;
  - Available through `Base64` class;
- base64url: 
  - Base64 with URL/filename safe character alphabet.
  - Available through `Base64Url` class;

You can easily extend the `Encoder` class to create custom encoding styles. See [2.3 Creating custom encodings](#23-creating-custom-encodings).

### 2.1 Encoding

Encoding is available through the `encode()` static method in all encoder classes listed above.

```php
use Covaleski\DataEncoding\Base32;

$encoded = Base32::encode('Dunder Mifflin Paper Company, Inc.');
// Will produce: IR2W4ZDFOIQE22LGMZWGS3RAKBQXAZLSEBBW63LQMFXHSLBAJFXGGLQ=
```

### 2.2 Decoding

Decoding is available through the `decode()` static method in all encoder classes listed above.

```php
use Covaleski\DataEncoding\Base32;

$decoded = Base32::decode('4WGZPZF2VTULPLY=');
// Will produce: 南京路
```

### 2.3 Creating custom encodings

For custom encoding, you must extend the `Encoder` class and set the following properties (all static):

- `int $base`:
  - Required;
  - Is the number of characters the alphabet should have;
  - Must be a power of 2;
- `array $alphabet`:
  - Required;
  - Is a list with all the alphabet's characters;
  - Must have unique characters only;
  - Is accessed with indexes generated by the bits of input data;
- `bool $isCaseSensitive`:
  - Required;
  - Defines whether the alphabet is case-sensitive;
  - Example: if not case-sensitive, decoding `MZXW6===` and `mzxw6===` would generate identical results;
- `string $alphabetEncoding`:
  - Optional - defaults to "ASCII";
  - Is the encoding system used by the alphabet characters;
  - Non-ASCII alphabets MUST have their encoding explicitly defined;
  - Is used to build and split the encoded string;
- `string $paddingCharacter`:
  - Optional - defaults to "=";
  - Is used to pad encoded strings;
  - Must not exist in the alphabet.

Example with ASCII alphabet:

```php
class Base4 extends Encoder
{
    protected static array $alphabet = [
        'A', 'B', 'C', 'D',
    ];
    protected static int $base = 4;
    protected static bool $isCaseSensitive = true;
}

$encoded = Base8Emoji::encode('foo');
// Will produce: BCBCBCDDBCDD
```

Example with Unicode alphabet:

```php
use Covaleski\DataEncoding\Encoder;

class Base8Emoji extends Encoder
{
    protected static array $alphabet = [
        '😎', '😔', '😳', '💀', '🤡', '👀', '✊', '💅',
    ];
    protected static int $base = 8;
    protected static string $alphabetEncoding = 'UTF-8';
    protected static bool $isCaseSensitive = false;
}

$encoded = Base8Emoji::encode('foo');
// Will produce: 💀😔🤡✊💅👀👀💅
```
## 3 Testing

Tests were made with PHPUnit. Use the following command to run all of them.

```sh
./vendor/bin/phpunit
```
